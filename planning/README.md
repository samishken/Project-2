"As a User, I want to (something), so that I can (something else)"

- As a User, I want to (create and save new cars), so that I can (keep track of my inventory).
- As a User, I want to (Edit the car information), so that I can (give accurate information to cusotmers/update price changes/notify if it is sold).
- As a User, I want to (Delete cars from the inventory when they are sold), so that I can (they don't take space of old cars)
- As a User, I want to (show my inventory), so that customers can come see my products
- As a User, I want to (have a sign in page), so that I am the only person with additional information about the car.
